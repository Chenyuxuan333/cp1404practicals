# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I now break down large coding tasks (like building a full program) into smaller steps (e.g., first write the class, then test methods, finally add user input) instead of trying to do everything at once. This makes debugging easier and prevents feeling overwhelmed.
...

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I need to spend more time testing edge cases (like invalid user inputs or extreme values) instead of just verifying basic functionality. I also need to start assignments earlier—sometimes I delay and rush the final steps, leading to small errors.
...

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I consistently comment my code to explain key logic (e.g., what a is_vintage() method checks) and save draft versions of my work. This helps me track changes and understand my own code later, which I’ll definitely continue.
...

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop relying too quickly on looking up full solutions when stuck. Instead, I should first try to debug by printing variable values or rereading class notes—this will help me build problem-solving skills, not just copy code.
...

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I’d suggest adding short, weekly “mini-practice” coding exercises (15–20 minutes each) focused on one concept (e.g., only classes, or only loops). They’d help reinforce new topics regularly without taking too much time.
